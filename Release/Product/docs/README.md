### Dependencies
1. To use the Product function, be sure to install the latest version of **ZEPETO.Product Package** through the Package Manager.
2. Multiplayer is required to link with the studio. Import **Multiplay Component** through Module Importer.
3. Product API can be used only when there is a registered product and currency. In this module, normalized Currency and Item Id are used for easy understanding. [[Setting]](https://docs.zepeto.me/studio-world/docs/zepeto_product#how-to-apply-a-sample-of-zepeto-product)

### Use Tips
- The experience and level in the Product module are data that are not saved as settings to help understand the increase or decrease of Star Currency.
     > **Note**: Please use DataStorage to store experience and level data.
